This is my 3rd SACNAS conference and the first time there was a real ocean/earth science presence.   I brought 4 students and 1 post-doc to the conference, and we were all thrilled to see an ocean/earth science presence.  Two students commented that they found the career session highly useful. My favorite session of the whole conference was “ Belonging: A Documentary Short and Facilitated Conversation” The film was excellent, and the panel discussion eye-opening.  Last week, I met with a student who described the conference as life-changing.  A double-major in Marine Science and Hawaiian studies, he said that as a Native Hawaiian, he is now inspired to pursue a Ph.D..  Prior to the conference, he said he knew graduate school was an option, but he hadn’t felt the passion to pursue a Masters, let alone PhD, until now.  Mahalo for inspring my students.  If you’d like to have further conversations, please feel free to contact me (Barb Bruno, barb@hawaii.edu)"
